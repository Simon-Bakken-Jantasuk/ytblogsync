### Instructions
1. Give it executable permissions 
2. Move it to PATH 
3. Use the script by writing in stdin `ytblogsync`

#### What problem was solved?
I also run a blog– and I also run a YouTube channel. I wanted to be able to post a YouTube video and then create a post on my blog containing my video.
Instead of doing this manually– I then created a bash script instead.
